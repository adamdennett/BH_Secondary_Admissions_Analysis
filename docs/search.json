In there, it is claimed that the school role in 2026 will be 2276 pupils. If we sum the estimated 5-year olds across all catchments (excluding BL_HV_CN_KG as this is an aggregation of Blatchington Mill, Hove Park, Cardinal Newman and King’s School for comparison purposes late) we get 2444. This is a good sign that my estimates are in the right ballpark.\nThe reasons for the slight over-estimate are varied - some of these pupils will go to independent schools or be home schooled, reducing the B&H PAN estimates. Some children will have left the area and not been replaced by new arrivals, reducing the PAN estimates. There are probably other plausible reasons too, but we are close enough (168 off) for my broad observations to be valid.\nDividing the total PAN for each catchment by the estimated number of pupils living in that catchment and likely to want a place in a school in that catchment generates a ‘demand ratio’.\n\nA Demand Ratio over 1 indicates there are likely more pupils than places available in that catchment\nA Demand Ratio below 1 indicates there are likely more places available than pupils likely wanting a place in that catchment\n\nAs well as current suggested PANs, I include PANs proposed in 2026 under the Option A scenario published."

    "text": "Observations on Pupil Admission Number Reduction Proposals\nEverything below is indicative - Brighton and Hove Council can do this calculation properly with better data if they choose to and I would encourage them to do so as a priority.\n\nThe Hove Park / Blatchington Mill and Varndean / Dorothy Stringer Catchments currently appear to have more projected demand than places available. The Blatchington/Hove ratio should be taken with a bit of a pinch of salt as this catchment also includes the Cardinal Newman Catholic School (which, accepted, takes students from across the city) and the King’s Free School. The final row in the table includes these two schools in the catchment and we can see a noticable improvement to the projected demand ratio. We can probably expect the real demand ratio to be somewhere between the two.\nThe Longhill, Portslade and Patcham catchments appear to have broadly appropriate demand ratios\nThe Brighton Aldridge Catchment has significantly more places available than demand would suggest.\nPAN reductions for Option A in 2026 appear to be applied without reference to likely demand.\nFor Stringer/Varndean the reduction in places from 630 to 570 makes the demand ratio EVEN WORSE. Similar for Blatchington/Hove.\nNonsensically, catchments with low demand ratios already, (Patcham, Portslade, Brighton Aldridge) have NO CHANGE to their PANs in 2026.\nGiven current demand, it would make more sense to, at the very least, keep PANs steady for areas with already high demand and reduce PANs for areas with lower demand.\nThe current proposals to reduce PANs very much suggest a social engineering motivation (forcing high-demand catchments to reduce intake which would inevitably force students without places to seek education in other catchments, not over subscribed.\n\nAddendum -\nSince carrying out the above analysis, my attention has been drawn to the published Year-7 admissions statistics on the Council website - https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/allocation-factsheet-year-7-places-september-2024 - these numbers would appear to back-up my observations on demand within the city. There is very little evidence of demand for places at Brighton Aldridge and Longhill High School - the former with no proposed changes to a PAN which is already well above demand. Schools with very high demand (Dorothy Stringer and Varndean in particular) are facing cuts where current demand is so high that future demand is unlikely to dip below the PAN allowed."

The travel times are calculated using the R5R package and are based on people walking along the Open Street Map road network.\nNotably, we can see that at present, most children in most catchments can reasonably be expected to walk to their nearest secondary school in under 1hr. The exceptions are those who live in Whitehawk and Bevendean in the East of the City - areas which are persistently ranked as the most deprived in the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore analysis and validation of these preliminary results is required and indeed should have been carried out by Brighton and Hove Council already, but there are suggestions in the analysis that accessibility by Bus is not hugely different to walking after taking bus stop waiting times and walk times to stops into consideration.\nR5R takes GTFS data available from https://mobilitydatabase.org/ and uses detailed timetable information to generate these estimate, however, more work is needed to be confident of the patterns observed.\nHowever, Zooming in to Longhill High School in Rottingdean can calulating bus accessibility from the School, we can see that after taking wait-times into consideration, it might take at least 30 minutes to access even the A259 in Rottingdean, let alone access the City Centre.\nGiven that under Option B, there is a high probability that singificant numbers of pupils from Central Brighton would be forced to attend Longhill, this is a significant issue.\nWhen we look at the Car travel times in the map below that, it becomes clear what options most might be forced into taking."

Those who were 10 in 2021 will be 13 now and 16 in 2026, so I will focus on the 5-9 year olds.\n\n\nReading layer `EW_LSOA' from data source \n  `E:\\BH_Secondary_Admissions_Analysis\\data\\EW_LSOA.geojson' \n  using driver `GeoJSON'\nSimple feature collection with 35672 features and 11 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -6.418667 ymin: 49.86467 xmax: 1.763706 ymax: 55.81109\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\nDeleting layer not supported by driver `GeoJSON'\nDeleting layer `BrightonLSOASchoolChildren' failed\nWriting layer `BrightonLSOASchoolChildren' to data source \n  `E:/BH_Secondary_Admissions_Analysis/data/BrightonLSOASchoolChildren.geojson' using driver `GeoJSON'\nUpdating existing layer BrightonLSOASchoolChildren\nWriting 165 features with 27 fields and geometry type Multi Polygon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map above shows the location quotient of 5-9 year olds in Brighton and Hove. Location Quotient is a measure of the concentration of young people in each LSOA relative to the city average. It’s a ratio, so a value of 1 means the same as the city average, above 1 means more than average, below 1 means less than average.\nYou can see that very few people due to go into secondary school in 2026 live in the city centre, with the highest concentrations in the outer northern, western and eastern areas of the city."

In there, it is claimed that the school role in 2026 will be 2276 pupils. If we sum the estimated 5-year olds across all catchments (excluding BL_HV_CN_KG as this is an aggregation of Blatchington Mill, Hove Park, Cardinal Newman and King’s School for comparison purposes late) we get 2444. This is a good sign that my estimates are in the right ballpark.\nThe reasons for the slight over-estimate are varied - some of these pupils will go to independent schools or be home schooled, reducing the B&H PAN estimates. Some children will have left the area and not been replaced by new arrivals, reducing the PAN estimates. There are probably other plausible reasons too, but we are close enough (168 off) for my broad observations to be valid.\nDividing the total PAN for each catchment by the estimated number of pupils living in that catchment and likely to want a place in a school in that catchment generates a ‘demand ratio’.\n\nA Demand Ratio over 1 indicates there are likely more pupils than places available in that catchment\nA Demand Ratio below 1 indicates there are likely more places available than pupils likely wanting a place in that catchment\n\nAs well as current suggested PANs, I include PANs proposed in 2026 under the Option A scenario published."

The Blatchington/Hove ratio should be taken with a bit of a pinch of salt as this catchment also includes the Cardinal Newman Catholic School (which, accepted, takes students from across the city) and the King’s Free School. The final row in the table includes these two schools in the catchment and we can see a noticable improvement to the projected demand ratio. We can probably expect the real demand ratio to be somewhere between the two.\nThe Longhill, Portslade and Patcham catchments appear to have broadly appropriate demand ratios\nThe Brighton Aldridge Catchment has significantly more places available than demand would suggest.\nPAN reductions for Option A in 2026 appear to be applied without reference to likely demand.\nFor Stringer/Varndean the reduction in places from 630 to 570 makes the demand ratio EVEN WORSE. Similar for Blatchington/Hove.\nNonsensically, catchments with low demand ratios already, (Patcham, Portslade, Brighton Aldridge) have NO CHANGE to their PANs in 2026.\nGiven current demand, it would make more sense to, at the very least, keep PANs steady for areas with already high demand and reduce PANs for areas with lower demand.\nThe current proposals to reduce PANs very much suggest a social engineering motivation (forcing high-demand catchments to reduce intake which would inevitably force students without places to seek education in other catchments, not over subscribed.\n\nAddendum -\nSince carrying out the above analysis, my attention has been drawn to the published Year-7 admissions statistics on the Council website - https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/allocation-factsheet-year-7-places-september-2024 - these numbers would appear to back-up my observations on demand within the city. There is very little evidence of demand for places at Brighton Aldridge and Longhill High School - the former with no proposed changes to a PAN which is already well above demand. Schools with very high demand (Dorothy Stringer and Varndean in particular) are facing cuts where current demand is so high that future demand is unlikely to dip below the PAN allowed."

The travel times are calculated using the R5R package and are based on people walking along the Open Street Map road network.\nNotably, we can see that at present, most children in most catchments can reasonably be expected to walk to their nearest secondary school in under 1hr. The exceptions are those who live in Whitehawk and Bevendean in the East of the City - areas which are persistently ranked as the most deprived in the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore analysis and validation of these preliminary results is required and indeed should have been carried out by Brighton and Hove Council already, but there are suggestions in the analysis that accessibility by Bus is not hugely different to walking after taking bus stop waiting times and walk times to stops into consideration.\nR5R takes GTFS data available from https://mobilitydatabase.org/ and uses detailed timetable information to generate these estimate, however, more work is needed to be confident of the patterns observed.\nHowever, Zooming in to Longhill High School in Rottingdean can calulating bus accessibility from the School, we can see that after taking wait-times into consideration, it might take at least 30 minutes to access even the A259 in Rottingdean, let alone access the City Centre.\nGiven that under Option B, there is a high probability that singificant numbers of pupils from Central Brighton would be forced to attend Longhill, this is a significant issue.\nWhen we look at the Car travel times in the map below that, it becomes clear what options most might be forced into taking."

    "text": "The PAN Problems\nIt has become clearer to me over the last week that one of the big issues in this whole consultation process is the PAN - both the total PAN in different years, which relates to population projections produced by the Council, and the individual school-level PANs which affect how many pupils a school can admit at year 7. I will take each in turn, but first some local background.\nIn most secondary schools in Brighton (Stringer, Varndean, Hove Park, Blatchington, Patcham, Longhill) the PAN is set by the council.\nReligious and Free Schools such as Cardinal Newman and King’s School are allowed to set their own PANs.\nAcademies (Brighton Aldridge Community Academy - BACA, and Portslade Aldridge Community Academy - PACA) are also allowed to set their own PANs.\nOne issue is that PANs for all schools contribute to the overall total number of places in the City. So if the Council is determined to reduce the number of places (PANs) in the city, if the Religious Schools and the Academies refuse to reduce their PANs and the council is wedded to reducing numbers, the only way it can do this is by cutting, proportionally, MORE places from Stringer, Varndean, Hove Park, Blatchington, Patcham, Longhill than it would have done if it could control PANs in all state funded schools in the City.\nIn the People Overview and Scrutiny Committee held on 9/10/2024, Councillor (Haver* NB check name, this is what it sounded like live) raised a point that a Government White Paper is on the horizon which may give local authorities the power to control ALL PANs in the near future - this could alleviate some of the issues I am about to describe, but at the moment, nothing can be done."

This represents 14% of the total places available.\nAs an interesting aside, we know from the 2021 Census that 30.9% of the population of Brighton identify as Christian - https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/maps/choropleth/identity/religion/religion-tb/christian?lad=E06000043 - if we believe wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_Kingdom - 13% of Christians in the UK are Catholic. So if we apply that percentage to Brighton, we can expect 3.9% of the population to be Roman Catholic. But 14% of the school places can be reserved for Catholic Children as a priority.

It’s likely that schools in multi-school catchments may receive both first and second choices, potentially artificially inflating that number relative to the schools in single school catchments, so bear that in mind, however it can still be viewed as a crude measure of demand. I will disaggregate 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choices in some other graphs below.\nAll schools within multi-school catchments are very popular and are able to easily fill their offer numbers and probably could at least twice over - which is useful context when considering PAN reductions.\nSome schools in Brighton received low numbers of applications. For BACA and Longhill, the numbers of applications they received were BELOW their PANs. These were not popular schools in 2024.\nFor BACA and Longhill, their total offer numbers were also below their PANs. This means the schools were very under-subscribed and had excess capacity."
